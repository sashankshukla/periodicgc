### Reference-Counted Smart Pointer with Periodic GC in C++

This project implements a reference-counted smart pointer system in C++ with a periodic garbage collector (GC) that helps to automatically reclaim memory that is no longer in use. This kind of system ensures deterministic deallocation of memory and can be beneficial in contexts where manual memory management may be error-prone.

#### Features:
- **Reference Counting**: Each object managed by the smart pointer keeps track of the number of references pointing to it.
- **Smart Pointer**: A templated smart pointer class that automatically updates reference counts when constructed, copied, or destroyed.
- **Periodic Garbage Collector**: A garbage collector that periodically checks for and deletes objects with a reference count of zero.

#### Components:

1. **RefCountedObject**: A base class that offers reference counting capabilities.
2. **SmartPtr**: A templated smart pointer class that manages `RefCountedObject` derived objects.
3. **PeriodicGC**: A singleton class that provides periodic garbage collection capabilities.

#### How to Use:

1. Derive your class from `RefCountedObject` to enable reference counting for it.
2. Instead of using raw pointers, use the `SmartPtr` class to manage the lifetime of your objects.
3. Register your smart pointers with the `PeriodicGC` system to ensure they are monitored for deletion.
4. Periodically call the `runGC` method of the `PeriodicGC` class to perform garbage collection.

#### Sample Usage:

```cpp
class MyClass : public RefCountedObject {
    // Your class definition
};

// Using the smart pointer
SmartPtr<MyClass> obj = new MyClass();

// Registering with the GC
PeriodicGC::instance().registerPtr(&obj);

// Periodically run the GC (e.g., in a game loop or main loop)
PeriodicGC::instance().runGC();
```

#### Notes:

- Ensure that any class you wish to manage with `SmartPtr` is derived from `RefCountedObject`.
- Always remember to unregister pointers from the `PeriodicGC` if they are going out of scope or will no longer be used.
